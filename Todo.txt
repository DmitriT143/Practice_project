Roller in discord with dice rolls in following format

[amount of dice] + [type of dice(any)] + {repeat if necessary}

additions maybe debatable, but i'll add a small feature for [GAME IN PROCESS]

Roller outside of discord (app)

Done on PyQT5 with same
maybe make something like presets I don't know

with saved 10 last results
maybe make it save those results to text file
with time before them to add up
or maybe make them swap... dunno it seems kinda hard
